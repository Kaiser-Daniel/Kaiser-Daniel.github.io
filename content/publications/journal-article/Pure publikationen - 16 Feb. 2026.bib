We aimed to determine whether emergent carotid stenting (eCAS) during endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) for anterior circulation tandem lesions improves 90-day functional outcomes compared with a no-stenting strategy.METHODS: We conducted an international multicenter longitudinal retrospective cohort study (CERES-TANDEM, NCT06965036) of consecutive adults treated at 49 comprehensive stroke centers in Europe, North America, and Singapore for anterior circulation acute ischemic stroke due to tandem lesions from January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2024. Exclusion criteria were primary hemorrhagic stroke, absence of intracranial occlusion, presentation >24 hours from symptom onset, and age younger than 18 years. We compared 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores between participants receiving eCAS and those receiving no stenting during EVT. The primary estimand was mRS shift, analyzed by stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW)-weighted ordinal regression. Additional estimands were direct-effect estimand adjusting for successful recanalization (defined as Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction grade 2b or higher) and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) (estimand 2) and stratum estimand restricting to never-crossers (estimand 3).RESULTS: Of 4,053 patients (mean age 70 years, 65.5\% female), 2,522 underwent eCAS and 1,531 received no stenting. After IPTW, eCAS was associated with an improved 90-day functional outcome (common odds ratio (OR) 1.31; 95\% CI 1.17-1.47;p < 0.001) and higher odds of mRS score 0-1 (OR 1.27; 95\% CI 1.08-1.50; p = 0.005) and mRS score 0-2 (OR 1.30; 95\% CI 1.13-1.51; p < 0.001), without a significant increase in sICH (OR 1.21; 95\% CI 0.93-1.56; p = 0.15). Findings were consistent in direct-effect (common OR 1.17; 95\% CI 1.04-1.31; p = 0.008) and stratum (common OR 1.37; 95\% CI 1.21-1.55; p < 0.001) estimands. There was no interaction for intracranial occlusion site, IV thrombolysis, sedation technique, EVT approach, or access site. Sensitivity analysis including recanalization in IPTW-weighted estimand 1 framework confirmed the association of eCAS with improved 90-day functional outcomes (common OR 1.14, 95\% CI1.02-1.27, p = 0.008).DISCUSSION: In this large real-world cohort, eCAS during EVT for anterior circulation tandem lesions was associated with superior 90-day functional recovery without increased hemorrhagic risk. These findings support consideration of eCAS in clinical practice and warrant confirmation in randomized trials.TRIAL REGISTRATION INFORMATION: Registered in clinicaltrials.gov, NCT06965036.CLASSIFICATION OF EVIDENCE: This study provides Class II evidence that in patients with stroke due to anterior circulation tandem lesions, eCAS during EVT improves 90-day functional outcomes compared with EVT alone.",  keywords  = "Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Endovascular Procedures/methods, Ischemic Stroke/surgery, Longitudinal Studies, Retrospective Studies, Stents, Thrombectomy/methods, Treatment Outcome",  author    = "\{for CERES-TANDEM\} and Michele Romoli and Molina, \{Carlos A\} and Elena Zapata-Arriaza and Vinay Jaikumar and Jessica Jesser and Heldner, \{Mirjam Rachel\} and Giovanni Merlino and Francesco Arba and Fabrizio Giammello and Radu, \{Razvan Alexandru\} and Lucio D'Anna and Guido Bigliardi and Uta Hanning and Luca Scarcia and Volker Puetz and \{Abu Amara\}, Abdulrahman and Andrea Zini and Patrik Michel and \{Aguiar De Sousa\}, Diana and \{Al Kasab\}, Sami and Barbara Casolla and \{K{\"u}hne Escol{\`a}\}, Jordi and \{Da Ros\}, Valerio and Alessandro Pezzini and Paolo Candelaresi and Alexandre, \{Andrea M\} and Danilo Toni and Marto, \{Jo{\~a}o Pedro\} and Gabrieli, \{Joseph Domenico\} and Sousa, \{Jo{\~a}o Andr{\'e}\} and Roland Schwab and Kemal Alpay and Maurizio Paciaroni and Rapillo, \{Costanza Maria\} and Leonard Yeo and Stefan Greisenegger and Nolte, \{Christian H\} and Stefano Caproni and Aikaterini Anastasiou and Rossana Tassi and Volker Maus and Simona Lattanzi and Thanki, \{Shail S\} and Antioco Sanna and Marcello Naccarato and Christine Hawkes and Abraham, \{Michael G\} and Valentina Tudisco and Manuel Requena and Daniel Kaiser",  year      = "2026",  month     = jan,  day       = "27",  doi       = "10.1212/WNL.0000000000214528",  language  = "English",  volume    = "106",  journal   = "Neurology",  issn      = "0028-3878",  publisher = "Lippincott Williams and Wilkins",  number    = "2",}

Patients with a prestroke modified Rankin Scale score of >3 or age <18 were excluded. We categorized patients by onset mode as witnessed or unwitnessed. The primary outcome was the modified Rankin Scale shift at 90 days. Secondary outcomes were functional independence, a composite of functional independence or return of Rankin to prestroke level, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, mortality, and a composite of severe disability or mortality at 90 days. We applied inverse probability of treatment weighting to compare outcomes between the groups.RESULTS: Of 5098 patients assessed for eligibility, we included 2073, of whom 1760 (84.9\%) had unwitnessed onset, and 313 (15.1\%) were witnessed. In the univariate comparison (before inverse probability of treatment weighting), 38.8\% of the unwitnessed and 45.7\% of the witnessed patients achieved functional independence (P=0.022). Mortality was 21.6\% among unwitnessed and 22.0\% among witnessed (P=0.847), and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage rates were 6.6\% and 5.8\%, respectively (P=0.623). The primary outcome (modified Rankin Scale shift) showed no difference comparing unwitnessed to witnessed patients (odds ratio, 1.35 [95\% CI, 0.82-2.20]; P=0.235) in the inverse probability of treatment weighting. Unwitnessed patients were more likely to achieve functional independence or return of Rankin (1.53 [1.01-2.33]; P=0.045).

We aimed to assess whether higher serum HDL-C levels modulate the risk of intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) after thrombectomy in human stroke survivors.METHODS: We included consecutive patients from our prospective anterior circulation large vessel occlusion (acLVO) registry who underwent thrombectomy between 01/2017 and 01/2023 at the tertiary stroke centre of the University Hospital Carl Gustav Carus in Dresden, Germany in a propensity score-matched analysis. We assessed the association between serum HDL-C levels and post-interventional ICH as well as 90-day functional outcome quantified by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). For sensitivity analysis, we used multivariable lasso logistic regression. Analyses were adjusted for demographics, cardiovascular risk profiles, stroke characteristics, and procedural times.RESULTS: Of 1702 patients screened, 807 (420 women, median age 77 years [66-84, IQR]) were included. Post-interventional ICH reduced the probability of a favourable functional outcome (90-day mRS 0-2) by 14.8\% ({\ss} = 0.15; 95\% CI [0.06;0.24]; p = 0.001.

We sought to determine the frequency of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) detection by standardized lower extremity venous compression ultrasound (LE-CUS) in patients with acute cerebral ischemia and cardiac right-to left shunt due to PFO or ASD on transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE).METHODS: We analysed consecutive patients (01/2015-12/2020) with acute cerebral ischemia and PFO or ASD on TEE, who received DVT screening by LE-CUS per institutional standard. We determined clinical baseline variables including shunt-size categorized as small, medium or large, and analysed the frequency of DVT. We performed multivariable analysis to identify predictors for presence of DVT on LE-CUS.RESULTS: Among 1564 patients with acute ischemic stroke (n = 1326) or TIA (n = 238) who received TEE, 390 patients had PFO and 10 patients ASD, of whom 274 were screened for DVT by LE-CUS (153 [55.8\%] female, age 64 years [51-76], NIHSS score 4 [1-9.5]). Of these, 55 patients (20.1\%) had DVT on LE-CUS. Among patients with DVT, 23 of 76 patients (30.3\%) who received LE-CUS within 72 h from admission compared to 32 of 198 patients (16.2\%) who received LE-CUS at later time points had presence of DVT (p = 0.012). The percentage of patients with DVT tended to be higher among patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke compared to patients with other stroke etiologies (21.8\% [49 of 225] vs. 12.2\% [6 of 49]; p = 0.168). Presence of DVT was associated with female sex (OR 2.24, 95\%CI 1.09-4.62), NIHSS score (OR 1.06, 95\%CI 1.03-1.10), Wells score (OR 1.54, 95\%CI 1.11-2.13) and shunt size (OR 3.32, 95\%CI 1.86-5.91).CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a high diagnostic yield (> 20\%) of standardized screening for DVT with LE-CUS in patients with acute cerebral ischemia and PFO or ASD.

The effect of EVT for occlusion of medium or distal vessels is unclear.METHODS: We randomly assigned participants with an isolated occlusion of medium or distal vessels (occlusion of the nondominant or codominant M2 segment of the middle cerebral artery [MCA]; the M3 or M4 segment of the MCA; the A1, A2, or A3 segment of the anterior cerebral artery; or the P1, P2, or P3 segment of the posterior cerebral artery) to receive EVT plus best medical treatment or best medical treatment alone within 24 hours after the participant was last seen to be well. The primary outcome was the level of disability at 90 days, as assessed with the modified Rankin scale score.RESULTS: A total of 543 participants (women, 44\%; median age, 77 years) were included in the analysis: 271 were assigned to receive EVT plus best medical treatment and 272 to receive best medical treatment alone. The median score on the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (range, 0 to 42, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms) at admission was 6 (interquartile range, 5 to 9). Intravenous thrombolysis was given to 65.4\% of the participants. The predominant occlusion locations were the M2 segment (in 44.0\% of the participants), M3 segment (in 26.9\%), P2 segment (in 13.4\%), and P1 segment (in 5.5\%). In the comparison between EVT plus best medical treatment and best medical treatment alone, no significant difference in the distribution of modified Rankin scale scores was observed at 90 days (common odds ratio for improvement in the score, 0.90; 95\% confidence interval, 0.67 to 1.22; P = 0.50). All-cause mortality was similar in the two groups (15.5\% with EVT plus best medical treatment and 14.0\% with best medical treatment alone), as was the incidence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (5.9\% and 2.6\%, respectively).CONCLUSIONS: In persons with stroke with occlusion of medium or distal vessels, EVT did not result in a lower level of disability or a lower incidence of death than best medical treatment alone.

Preventing thrombosis and stroke necessitates systemic anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapies with the risk of bleeding complications. Antithrombotic coatings present a promising solution.METHODS: In this study, we investigated the potential of hydrogels composed of four-armed poly(ethylene glycol) (starPEG) and heparin, with or without coagulation-responsive heparin release, as coatings for neurovascular devices to mitigate blood clot formation. We evaluated the feasibility and efficacy of these coatings on neurovascular devices through in vitro Chandler-Loop assays and implantation experiments in the supra-aortic arteries of rabbits.RESULTS: Stable and coagulation-responsive starPEG-heparin hydrogel coatings exhibited antithrombotic efficacy in vitro, although with a slightly reduced thromboprotection observed in vivo. Furthermore, the hydrogel coatings demonstrated robustness against shear forces encountered during deployment and elicited only marginal humoral and cellular inflammatory responses compared with the reference standards.CONCLUSION: Heparin hydrogel coatings offer promising benefits for enhancing the hemocompatibility of neurointerventional devices made of self-expanding nickel-titanium alloy. The variance in performance between in vitro and in vivo settings may be attributed to differences in low- and high-shear blood flow conditions inherent to these models. These models may represent the differences in venous and arterial systems.

The Woven EndoBridge (WEB) device, particularly the lowest height of 2 mm variant, offers a potential alternative option for these aneurysms. This multicenter study evaluates the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the WEB for SSAs ≤ 4.1 mm width.METHODS: A total of 103 aneurysms (mean size: 3.4 ± 1.1 mm, 67 [65\%] bifurcation) treated with WEB single-layer sizes ranging from 3 × 2 mm to 4.5 × 2 mm were retrospectively analyzed. Data on procedural success, complications, and angiographic outcomes were collected. The incidence and potential strategies to counteract WEB protrusion were evaluated.RESULTS: WEB deployment was successful in 97 (94\%) cases, but WEB protrusion occurred in 12 (12\%) cases. Strategies to counteract WEB protrusion were change to another endovascular technique (n = 4), additional stent implantation (n = 4), change to a smaller WEB size (n = 3), and repositioning of the WEB (n = 1). Procedural thromboembolic complications occurred in 4 (4\%) cases, of which 3 were due to protrusion of the WEB, but all were asymptomatic. Two hemorrhagic complications (2\%), caused by aneurysm perforation with the microwire in the first case and with the folded WEB tip in the second, resulted in procedural morbidity (2\%).

Stroke severity at presentation is a key determinant of outcomes in acute ischemic stroke. This study aimed to examine the impact of brain frailty on initial stroke severity and recovery in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) patients undergoing endovascular thrombectomy (EVT).MethodsWe conducted a post hoc analysis of the ESCAPE-NA1 randomized-controlled trial that investigated the efficacy and safety of the neuroprotectant nerinetide in patients with AIS who received EVT. Brain frailty markers (cortical atrophy, subcortical atrophy, white matter hyperintensities, chronic infarcts) were visually assessed from baseline noncontrast CT scans. We explored the association between these markers and admission stroke severity (National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score) using multivariable quantile regression. We also assessed the NIHSS trajectory over 90 days using repeated-measures analysis. Models were adjusted for relevant covariates.ResultsAmong 1,102 participants (mean age 69.5 years; 49.7\% female), NIHSS scores at baseline were higher in patients with cortical atrophy and those with chronic infarcts compared with patients having no cortical atrophy or chronic infarcts after adjusting for confounders (adjusted difference for GCA1 vs GCA0 = 1.25 points [95\% CI 0.18-2.31], p = 0.021; adjusted difference for presence of chronic infarcts = 1.27 points [95\% CI 0.007-2.53, p = 0.049]). Subcortical atrophy, white matter hyperintensity burden, lacunes, and overall brain frailty were not associated with NIHSS scores at presentation. A repeated-measures analysis showed consistent higher NIHSS scores in individuals with brain frailty compared with those without, after the acute phase throughout the 90-day follow-up period (NIHSS score at 30 days, adjusted difference for total brain frailty score 1 vs 0 = 1.16 points [95\% CI 0.35-1.96], p = 0.01; brain frailty score 2/3 vs 0 = 0.98 [95\% CI 0.08-1.88], p = 0.03; NIHSS score at 90 days (adjusted difference for brain frailty score 1 vs 0 = 0.97 [95\% CI 0.19-1.75], p = 0.01; brain frailty score 2/3 vs 0 = 0.85 [95\% CI -0.01 to -1.71], p = 0.05).DiscussionThis study highlights the association of brain frailty with the clinical presentation and recovery trajectory of patients with AIS undergoing EVT.

Mortality at 90 days was 51.9\% and 16.3\% of patients reached mRS 0-2 at 90 days. Thrombolysis was not associated with worse outcome at 90 days.

We assessed the effects of platelet inhibition strategy and potentially covariates on the primary outcome of 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) using ordinal shift analysis with proportional odds models.RESULTS: RS was performed in 589 patients (mean age 67.9 years, 60.8\% male). Numerous combinations of platelet inhibitors were administered. Periprocedural GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors were used in 61.5\% of patients. Postprocedural DAPT was administered to 80.5\% and SAPT to 13.3\%. Functional independence (mRS 0-2) was achieved in 40.7\%, while 26.3\% died within 90 days. Stent occlusion occurred in 20.5\%, with 67.6\% of these occlusions within 24 h. Postprocedural stent-occlusion was independently associated with worse functional outcome at 90 days (OR 4.1, 95\% CI 2.3-7.2, p < 0.001). No significant association between periprocedural GPIIb/IIIa inhibitors, and 90-day mRS or stent occlusion was found. Postprocedural SAPT was associated with worse functional outcomes (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.4, 95\% CI 1.1-5.0, p = 0.02), higher mortality (aOR 2.1, 95\% CI 1.05-4.0, p = 0.03), and increased stent occlusion rates (aOR 4.8, 95\% CI 2.3-9.7, p < 0.001) compared to postprocedural DAPT. Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 6.8\% of patients, with no significant difference between antiplatelet regimens.CONCLUSION: Extensive heterogeneity exists in platelet inhibition strategies following RS. Stent occlusion is associated with worse clinical outcomes, and the first 24 h post-RS are critical for stent patency. Compared to SAPT, DAPT was associated with better functional outcome, lower mortality, and lower stent occlusion rates.",  author    = "Aikaterini Anastasiou and Alex Brehm and Johannes Kaesmacher and Adnan Mujanovic and \{de Dios Lascuevas\}, Marta and \{Carmona Fuentes\}, Tom{\'a}s and Alfonso L{\'o}pez-Fr{\'i}as and \{Hidalgo Valverde\}, Blanca and Ansgar Berlis and Maurer, \{Christoph J\} and Nguyen, \{Thanh N\} and Mohamad Abdalkader and Piers Klein and Guillaume Thevoz and Patrik Michel and Bruno Bartolini and Marius Kaschner and Daniel Weiss and Alexandre, \{Andrea M\} and Alessandro Pedicelli and Paolo Machi and Gianmarco Bernava and Shuntaro Kuwahara and Kazutaka Uchida and Jason Wenderoth and Anirudh Joshi and Grzegorz Karwacki and Manuel Bolognese and Agostino Tessitore and Vinci, \{Sergio Lucio\} and Amedeo Cervo and Claudia Rollo and Ferdinand Hui and Mozumder, \{Aaisha Siddiqua\} and Romano, \{Daniele Giuseppe\} and Giulia Frauenfelder and Nitin Goyal and Vivek Batra and Violiza Inoa and Christophe Cognard and Mat{\'u}{\v s} Hoferica and Riitta Rautio and Kaiser, \{Daniel P O\} and Gerber, \{Johannes C\} and Julian Clarke and Levitt, \{Michael R\} and Wolf, \{Marcel N\} and Othman, \{Ahmed E\} and Luca Scarcia and Erwah Kalsoum and Diana Melancia and \{de Sousa\}, \{Diana Aguiar\} and Ganimede, \{Maria Porzia\} and Vittorio Semeraro and Flavio Giordano and Massimo Muto and Aristeidis Katsanos and Umesh Bonala and Tuladhar, \{Anil M\} and Jenniskens, \{Sjoerd F M\} and Victoria Hellstern and Ilka Kleffner and Paolo Remida and Susanna Diamanti and Leonardo Renieri and Elena Ballabio and Luca Valvassori and Nikki Rommers and Mira Katan and Victor Schulze-Zachau and Marios-Nikos Psychogios",  note      = "Publisher Copyright: {\textcopyright} The Author(s), 2025.

As demand for thrombectomy rises and geographical disparities in stroke care access persist, there is a growing need for predictive models that quantify individual benefits. However, current imaging methods for estimating outcomes may not fully capture the dynamic nature of cerebral ischaemia and lack a patient-specific assessment of thrombectomy benefits. Our study introduces a deep learning approach to predict individual responses to thrombectomy in acute ischaemic stroke patients. The proposed models provide predictions for both tissue and clinical outcomes under two scenarios: one assuming successful reperfusion and another assuming unsuccessful reperfusion. The resulting simulations of penumbral salvage and difference in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at discharge quantify the potential individual benefits of the intervention. Our models were developed on an extensive dataset from routine stroke care, which included 405 ischaemic stroke patients who underwent thrombectomy. We used acute data for training (n = 304), including multimodal CT imaging and clinical characteristics, along with post hoc markers such as thrombectomy success, final infarct localization and NIHSS at discharge. We benchmarked our tissue outcome predictions under the observed reperfusion scenario against a thresholding-based clinical method and a generalized linear model. Our deep learning model showed significant superiority, with a mean Dice score of 0.48 on internal test data (n = 50) and 0.52 on external test data (n = 51), versus 0.26/0.36 and 0.34/0.35 for the baselines, respectively. The NIHSS sum score prediction achieved median absolute errors of 1.5 NIHSS points on the internal test dataset and 3.0 NIHSS points on the external test dataset, outperforming other machine learning models. By predicting the patient-specific response to thrombectomy for both tissue and clinical outcomes, our approach offers an innovative biomarker that captures the dynamics of cerebral ischaemia. We believe this method holds significant potential to enhance personalized therapeutic strategies and to facilitate efficient resource allocation in acute stroke care.",  keywords  = "Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Brain Ischemia/surgery, Deep Learning, Female, Humans, Ischemic Stroke/surgery, Male, Middle Aged, Thrombectomy/methods, Treatment Outcome",  author    = "\{von Braun\}, Marie-Sophie and Kristin Starke and Lucas Peter and Daniel K{\"u}rsten and Florian Welle and Schneider, \{Hans Ralf\} and Max Wawrzyniak and Kaiser, \{Daniel P O\} and Gordian Prasse and Cindy Richter and Elias Kellner and Marco Reisert and Julian Klingbeil and Anika Stockert and Karl-Titus Hoffmann and Gerik Scheuermann and Christina Gillmann and Dorothee Saur",  note      = "Publisher Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2025 Oxford University Press.

We hypothesised that higher serum HDL-C levels would have a protective effect against cerebral reperfusion injury in human stroke survivors treated with thrombectomy. MethodsWe included consecutive patients from our prospective anterior circulation large-vessel occlusion (acLVO) registry who underwent thrombectomy between January 2017 and January 2023 at a tertiary stroke centre in Germany in a propensity score-matched analysis. We assessed the association between serum HDL-C levels and imaging indices of post-interventional reperfusion injury according to the Heidelberg Bleeding Classification as well as 90-day functional outcome quantified by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS). We performed sensitivity analyses using multivariable lasso logistic and linear regression adjusted for demographic, clinical and imaging characteristics. ResultsOut of 1702 patients assessed for eligibility, 807 acLVO patients treated with thrombectomy (420 females, median age 77 years [66-84, IQR]) were included. Reperfusion injury reduced the probability of a favourable functional outcome (90-day mRS 0-2) by 14.8\% (\{beta\}=0.15; 95\% CI [0.06;0.24]; p=0.001.

Logistic regression analyses were used to derive a 9-point score for predicting good functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2 or return to premorbid modified Rankin Scale score) at 90 days, with sensitivity analyses for prespecified subgroups conducted using bootstrapped random forest regressions. Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 5-6), and 90-day survival. The score was externally validated with a single-center cohort (2014-2023). Of the 3231 included patients (n=2499 EVT), a 9-point score included age, early computed tomography ischemic changes, and stroke severity, with higher points indicating a higher probability of a good functional outcome. The areas under the curve for the primary outcome among EVT and best medical management subgroups were 0.72 (95\% CI, 0.70-0.74) and 0.87 (95\% CI, 0.84-0.90), respectively, with similar performance in the external validation cohort (area under the curve, 0.71 [95\% CI, 0.66-0.76]).

Methods: Data are from the randomized ESCAPE trial and a prospective cohort study (ESCAPE-LATE). Anterior circulation large vessel occlusion patients presenting > 6 hours from last-known-well were included, whereby collateral status was an inclusion criterion for ESCAPE but not ESCAPE-LATE. A Markov state transition model was built to estimate lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) for EVT in addition to best medical care vs. best medical care only in a clinical trial setting (comparing ESCAPE-EVT to ESCAPE control arm patients) and a real-world setting (comparing ESCAPE-LATE to ESCAPE control arm patients). We performed an unadjusted analysis, using 90-day modified Rankin Scale(mRS) scores as model input, and analysis adjusted for baseline factors. Acceptability of EVT was calculated using upper/lower willingness-to-pay thresholds of 100,000 USD/50,000 USD/QALY. Results: Two-hundred-forty-nine patients were included (ESCAPE-LATE:n=200, ESCAPE EVT-arm:n=29, ESCAPE control-arm:n=20). Late EVT in addition to best medical care was cost-effective in the unadjusted analysis both in the clinical trial and real-world setting, with acceptability 96.6\%-99.0\%.

The primary outcome was the composite of functional independence (FI; mRS score 0-2) or return to the pre-stroke mRS score (return of Rankin, RoR) at 90 days. Outcomes were compared between patients with pre-stroke disability (pre-stroke mRS score 2-4) and those without (mRS score 0-1).RESULTS: A total of 2,231 patients (median age, 72 years; median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, 16) were included in the present analysis. Of these, 564 (25\%) had pre-stroke disability. The primary outcome (FI or RoR) was observed in 30.7\% of patients with pre-stroke disability (FI, 16.5\%; RoR, 30.7\%) compared to 44.1\% of patients without (FI, 44.1\%; RoR, 13.0\%) (P<0.001). In multivariable logistic regression analysis with inverse probability of treatment weighting, pre-stroke disability was not associated with significantly lower odds of achieving FI or RoR (adjusted odds ratio 0.73, 95\% confidence interval 0.43-1.25). Symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage occurred in 6.3\% of both groups (P=0.995).CONCLUSION: A considerable proportion of patients with late-presenting LVO and pre-stroke disability regained pre-stroke mRS scores after EVT.

The aim of this study was to compare the clinical outcomes of patients with isolated posterior cerebral artery (PCA) occlusion stroke undergoing EVT by anesthesia modality with conscious sedation (non-GA) versus general anesthesia (GA).METHODS: Patients from the Posterior CerebraL Artery Occlusion (PLATO) study were analyzed with regard to anesthetic strategy. GA was compared with non-GA using multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of weighting treatment (IPTW) methods. The primary endpoint was the 90-day distribution of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Secondary outcomes included functional independence or return to Rankin at day 90, and successful reperfusion, defined as expanded Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (eTICI) 2b to 3. Safety endpoints were symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage and mortality.RESULTS: Among 376 patients with isolated PCA occlusion stroke treated with EVT, 183 (49\%) had GA. The treatment groups were comparable, although the GA group contained more patients with severe stroke and lower posterior circulation Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (pc-ASPECTS).

We aimed to prospectively analyse functional outcomes of endovascular thrombectomy versus best medical treatment in children with intracranial arterial occlusion stroke.METHODS: In this prospective registry study, 45 centres in 12 countries across Asia and Australia, Europe, North America, and South America reported functional outcomes for children aged between 28 days and 18 years presenting with arterial ischaemic stroke caused by a large-vessel or medium-vessel occlusion who received either endovascular thrombectomy plus best medical practice or best medical treatment alone. Intravenous thrombolysis was considered part of best medical treatment and therefore permitted in both groups. The primary outcome was the difference in median modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score between baseline (pre-stroke) and 90 days (±10 days) post-stroke, assessed by the Wilcoxon rank test (α=0·05). Efficacy outcomes in the endovascular thrombectomy and best medical treatment groups were compared in sensitivity analyses using propensity score matching. The Save ChildS Pro study is registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry, DRKS00018960.FINDINGS: Between Jan 1, 2020, and Aug 31, 2023, of the 241 patients in the Save ChildS Pro registry, 208 were included in the analysis (115 [55\%] boys and 93 [45\%] girls). 117 patients underwent endovascular thrombectomy (median age 11 years [IQR 6-14]), and 91 patients received best medical treatment (6 years [3-12]; p<0·0001). The median Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS) score on admission was 14 (IQR 10-19) in the endovascular thrombectomy group and 9 (5-13) in the best medical treatment group (p<0·0001). Both treatment groups had a median pre-stroke mRS score of 0 (IQR 0-0) at baseline. The change in median mRS score between baseline and 90 days was 1 (IQR 0-2) in the endovascular thrombectomy group and 2 (1-3) in the best medical treatment group (p=0·020). One (1\%) patient developed a symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (this patient was in the endovascular thrombectomy group). Six (5\%) patients in the endovascular thrombectomy group and four (5\%) patients in the best medical treatment group had died by day 90 (p=0·89). After propensity score matching for age, sex, and PedNIHSS score at hospital admission (n=79 from each group), the change in median mRS score between baseline and 90 days was 1 (IQR 0-2) in the endovascular thrombectomy group and 2 (1-3) in the best medical treatment group (p=0·029). Regarding the primary outcome for patients with suspected focal cerebral arteriopathy, endovascular thrombectomy (n=18) and best medical treatment (n=33) showed no difference in 90-day median mRS scores (2 [IQR 1-3] vs 2 [1-4]; p=0·074).INTERPRETATION: Clinical centres tended to select children with more severe strokes (higher PedNIHSS score) for endovascular thrombectomy. Nevertheless, endovascular thrombectomy was associated with improved functional outcomes in paediatric patients with large-vessel or medium-vessel occlusions compared with best medical treatment. Future studies need to investigate whether the positive effect of endovascular thrombectomy is confined to older and more severely affected children.FUNDING: None.",  author    = "Sporns, \{Peter B\} and Kartik Bhatia and Todd Abruzzo and Lisa Pabst and Stuart Fraser and Chung, \{Melissa G\} and Warren Lo and Ahmed Othman and Sebastian Steinmetz and Ulf Jensen-Kondering and Stefan Schob and Kaiser, \{Daniel P O\} and Wolfgang Marik and Christina Wendl and Ilka Kleffner and Hans Henkes and Hermann Kraehling and Nguyen-Kim, \{Thi Dan Linh\} and Ren{\'e} Chapot and Umut Yilmaz and Furene Wang and Hafeez, \{Muhammad Ubaid\} and Flavio Requejo and Nicola Limbucci and Birgit Kauffmann and Markus M{\"o}hlenbruch and Omid Nikoubashman and Schellinger, \{Peter D\} and Patricia Musolino and Ali Alawieh and Jenny Wilson and Dominik Grieb and Gersing, \{Alexandra S\} and Thomas Liebig and Martin Olivieri and Schwabova, \{Jaroslava Paulasova\} and Ales Tomek and Panagiotis Papanagiotou and Gr{\'e}goire Boulouis and Olivier Naggara and Fox, \{Christine K\} and Kirill Orlov and Alexandra Kuznetsova and Carmen Parra-Farinas and Prakash Muthusami and Regenhardt, \{Robert W\} and Dmytriw, \{Adam A\} and Tanja Burkard and Mesha Martinez and Daniel Brechb{\"u}hl and Maja Steinlin and Sun, \{Lisa R\} and Hassan, \{Ameer E\} and Andr{\'e} Kemmling and Sarah Lee and Fullerton, \{Heather J\} and Jens Fiehler and Marios-Nikos Psychogios and Moritz Wildgruber",  note      = "Copyright {\textcopyright} 2024 The Author(s).

We compared the outcomes of PCAo patients treated with endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) with or without intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) to patients treated with IVT alone.METHODS: From the multicenter retrospective Posterior cerebraL ArTery Occlusion (PLATO) registry, we included patients with isolated PCAo treated with reperfusion therapy within 24 hours of onset between January 2015 and August 2022. The primary outcome was the distribution of the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at 3 months. Other outcomes comprised 3-month excellent (mRS 0-1) and independent outcome (mRS 0-2), early neurological improvement (ENI), mortality, and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH).

We aimed to compare clinical and safety outcomes of best medical treatment (BMT) versus EVT + BMT in patients with stroke due to isolated ICA occlusion.METHODS: We conducted a retrospective multicenter study involving patients with isolated ICA occlusion between January 2016 and December 2020. We stratified patients by BMT versus EVT and matched the groups using propensity score matching (PSM). We assessed the effect of treatment strategy on favorable outcome (modified Rankin scale ≤ 2) 90 days after treatment and compared reduction in NIHSS score at discharge, rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and 3‑month mortality.RESULTS: In total, we included 149 patients with isolated ICA occlusion.

We aimed to evaluate whether the association between endovascular treatment (EVT) and outcomes in iPCAO acute ischemic stroke is modified by initial stroke severity (baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale [NIHSS]) and arterial occlusion site.METHODS: Based on the multicenter, retrospective, case-control study of consecutive iPCAO acute ischemic stroke patients (PLATO study [Posterior Cerebral Artery Occlusion Stroke]), we assessed the heterogeneity of EVT outcomes compared with medical management (MM) for iPCAO, according to baseline NIHSS score (≤6 versus >6) and occlusion site (P1 versus P2), using multivariable regression modeling with interaction terms. The primary outcome was the favorable shift of 3-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS). Secondary outcomes included excellent outcome (mRS score 0-1), functional independence (mRS score 0-2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality.RESULTS: From 1344 patients assessed for eligibility, 1059 were included (median age, 74 years; 43.7\% women; 41.3\% had intravenous thrombolysis): 364 receiving EVT and 695 receiving MM. Baseline stroke severity did not modify the association of EVT with 3-month mRS distribution ( P interaction=0.312) but did with functional independence ( P interaction=0.010), with a similar trend on excellent outcome ( P interaction=0.069). EVT was associated with more favorable outcomes than MM in patients with baseline NIHSS score >6 (mRS score 0-1, 30.6\% versus 17.7\%; adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.01 [95\% CI, 1.22-3.31]; mRS score 0 to 2, 46.1\% versus 31.9\%; aOR, 1.64 [95\% CI, 1.08-2.51]) but not in those with NIHSS score ≤6 (mRS score 0-1, 43.8\% versus 46.3\%; aOR, 0.90 [95\% CI, 0.49-1.64]; mRS score 0-2, 65.3\% versus 74.3\%; aOR, 0.55 [95\% CI, 0.30-1.0]). EVT was associated with more symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage regardless of baseline NIHSS score ( P interaction=0.467), while the mortality increase was more pronounced in patients with NIHSS score ≤6 ( P interaction=0.044; NIHSS score ≤6: aOR, 7.95 [95\% CI, 3.11-20.28]; NIHSS score >6: aOR, 1.98 [95\% CI, 1.08-3.65]).

CONCLUSIONS: Baseline clinical stroke severity, rather than the occlusion site, may be an important modifier of the association between EVT and outcomes in iPCAO.

Addressing this subject, we report our multicenter experience.METHODS AND RESULTS: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with COVID-19 and known vaccination status treated with mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke at 20 tertiary care centers between January 2020 and January 2023. Baseline demographics, angiographic outcome, and clinical outcome evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale score at discharge were noted. A multivariate analysis was conducted to test whether these variables were associated with an unfavorable outcome, defined as modified Rankin Scale score >3. A total of 137 patients with acute ischemic stroke (48 vaccinated and 89 unvaccinated) with acute or subsided COVID-19 infection who underwent mechanical thrombectomy attributable to vessel occlusion were included in the study. Angiographic outcomes between vaccinated and unvaccinated patients were similar (modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction ≥2b: 85.4\% in vaccinated patients versus 86.5\% in unvaccinated patients; P=0.859).

To evaluate the association of bridging IVT and functional outcome quantified via modified Rankin Scale score at 90 days we used multivariable logistic and lasso regression including interaction terms with grade of reperfusion quantified via modified Thrombolysis in Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) scale and distal thrombus migration adjusted for demographic and cardiovascular risk profiles, clinical and imaging stroke characteristics, onset-to-recanalization time and distal thrombus migration. We performed sensitivity analysis using propensity score matching. In our study population of 1000 thrombectomy-eligible patients (513 women; median age, 77 years [interquartile range, 67-84]), IVT emerged as a predictor of favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score, 0-2) independent of modified mTICI score (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95\% CI, 0.32-0.75]; P=0.001). In those who underwent thrombectomy (n=812), the association of IVT and favorable functional outcome was reproduced (adjusted odds ratio, 0.49 [95\% CI, 0.31-0.74]; P=0.001) and was further confirmed on propensity score analysis, where IVT led to a 0.35-point decrease in 90-day modified Rankin Scale score ({\ss}=-0.35 [95 CI\%, -0.68 to 0.01]; P=0.04). The additive benefit of IVT remained independent of modified mTICI score ({\ss}=-1.79 [95\% CI, -3.43 to -0.15]; P=0.03) and distal thrombus migration ({\ss}=-0.41 [95\% CI, -0.69 to -0.13]; P=0.004) on interaction analysis.

We evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients selected for EVT by NCCT compared with those medically managed in the extended time window.METHODS: This multinational cohort study was conducted at 66 sites across 10 countries. Consecutive patients with proximal anterior LVO stroke selected for EVT by NCCT or medically managed and presenting within 6-24 hours of time last seen well (TSLW) from January 2014 to May 2022 were included. The primary end point was the 90-day ordinal shift in the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. Inverse probability treatment weighting (IPTW) and multivariable methods were used.RESULTS: Of 5,098 patients screened, 839 patients were included, with a median (interquartile range) age of 75 (64-83) years; 455 (54.2\%) were women. There were 616 patients selected to undergo EVT by NCCT (73.4\%) and 223 (26.6\%) who were medically managed. In IPTW analyses, there was a more favorable 90-day ordinal mRS shift in patients selected by NCCT to EVT vs those who were medically managed (odds ratio [OR] 1.99, 95\% CI 1.53-2.59; p < 0.001). There were higher rates of 90-day functional independence (mRS 0-2) in the EVT group (40.1\% vs 18.4\%, OR 3.31, 95\% CI 2.11-5.20; p < 0.001). sICH was nonsignificantly higher in the EVT group (8.5\% vs 1.4\%, OR 3.77, 95\% CI 0.72-19.7, p = 0.12). Mortality at 90 days was lower in the EVT vs MM group (23.9\% vs 32.3\%, OR 0.61, 95\% CI 0.45-0.83, p = 0.002).DISCUSSION: In patients with proximal anterior LVO in the extended time window, there was a lower rate of disability and mortality in patients selected with NCCT and CTA to EVT compared with those who were medically managed.

It is unclear if specific devices or novel coating technologies may impact their occurrence.METHODS: We conducted a multicenter study on the incidence of NICE lesions after flow diverter (FD) implantation for cerebral aneurysm treatment.RESULTS: Eight centers identified 15 patients and provided detailed data. The clinical presentation ranged from asymptomatic to hemiplegia and cognitive impairment. The mean time to diagnosis after treatment was 65.1±101.5 days. Five centers disclosed information on all of their 1201 FD procedures during the inclusion period (2015-2022), during which 12 patients were diagnosed with NICE lesions in these institutions-that is, an incidence of 1\%. FD coatings did not increase the incidence (6/591 patients (1\%) treated with surface-modified FD vs 6/610 patients (1\%) treated with bare FD; P=1.00). Significantly increased rates of 3.7\% (6 cases in 161 procedures; P<0.01) and 3.3\% (5 cases in 153 procedures; P<0.01) were found with stents of two specific product lines. The use of one product line was associated with a significantly lower incidence (0 cases in 499 procedures (0\%); P<0.01).CONCLUSIONS: Novel stent coatings are not associated with an increased incidence of NICE lesions.

We aimed to compare the clinical outcomes and safety of bridging IVT in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to anterior circulation large vessel occlusion who underwent EVT 6 to 24 hours after time last known well.METHODS: We enrolled patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion stroke and a National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of ≥6 from 20 centers across 10 countries in the multicenter retrospective CLEAR study (CT for Late Endovascular Reperfusion) between January 2014 and May 2022. We used inverse probability of treatment weighting modeling adjusted for clinical and imaging confounders to compare functional outcomes, reperfusion success, symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, and mortality between EVT patients with and without prior IVT.RESULTS: Of 5098 patients screened for eligibility, we included 2749 patients, of whom 549 received bridging IVT before EVT. The timing of IVT was not recorded. Witnessed stroke onset and transfer rates were higher in the bridging IVT group (25\% versus 12\% and 77\% versus 55\%, respectively, P value for both <0.0001), and time intervals between stroke onset and treatment were shorter (time last known well-start of EVT median 560 minutes [interquartile range, 432-791] versus 724 minutes [interquartile range, 544-912]; P<0.0001). After adjustment for confounders, there was no difference in functional outcome at 3 months (adjusted common odds ratio for modified Rankin Scale shift, 1.03 [95\% CI, 0.89-1.19]; P=0.72) or successful reperfusion (adjusted odds ratio, 1.19 [95\% CI, 0.81-1.75]; P=0.39).

In the extended time window beyond six hours, patient selection is primarily guided by perfusion-based CT imaging using thresholds. However, this approach may not fully capture the rich information contained within high-dimensional CT data. In contrast, advanced machine learning techniques have demonstrated their capacity to model complex relationships between multiparametric data, producing more precise predictions of the final infarct extent. Objective: Our study aims to develop and validate a deep learning approach that improves the prediction of final infarct based on the thrombectomy outcome. Methods: We conducted a multicenter retrospective study involving 405 stroke patients with acute proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent EVT. To gain insights from this dataset, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) featuring a 3D multi-path hybrid-fusion architecture and attention units. The model leverages acute multimodal CT imaging as well as clinical and demographic characteristics. After being trained with knowledge of the thrombectomy outcome and final infarct localization as post-hoc assessed markers, our model can simulate the individual tissue outcomes of both successful and unsuccessful thrombectomy for new patients. The predictive accuracy of the CNN was benchmarked against a thresholding-based method as used in clinical practice and a generalized linear model (GLM). Results: By integrating multiparametric imaging data and patient-specific factors, our CNN enables individual voxel-based infarct prediction depending on thrombectomy outcome. When tested on an internal (n = 50) and an external dataset (n = 51), it outperformed both methodological baselines significantly in terms of spatial accuracy with Dice scores of 0.47/0.52 vs. 0.26/0.36 and 0.34/0.35 for the thresholding-method and the GLM, respectively Conclusion: Our deep learning model allows for a robust prediction of the final infarct extent as a function of thrombectomy success.

We analyzed the effect of EVT among these stroke patients in real-world settings.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The CT for Late Endovascular Reperfusion (CLEAR) study recruited patients from 66 centers in 10 countries between 01/2014 and 05/2022. The extended time-window was defined as 6-24 h from last-seen-well to treatment. The primary outcome was shift of the 3-month modified Rankin scale (mRS) score. Safety outcomes included symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH) and mortality. Outcomes were analyzed with ordinal and logistic regressions.RESULTS: Among 5098 screened patients, 2451 were included in the analysis (median age 73, 55\% women). Of patients with ASPECTS 0-5 (n = 310), receiving EVT (n = 209/310) was associated with lower 3-month mRS when compared to medical management (median 4 IQR 3-6 vs 6 IQR 4-6; aOR 0.4, 95\% CI 0.2-0.7). Patients undergoing EVT had higher sICH (11.2\% vs 4.0\%; aOR 4.1, 95\% CI 1.2-18.8) and lower mortality (31.6\% vs 58.4\%, aOR 0.4; 95\% CI 0.2-0.9) compared to medically managed patients.

Such a scale could be used to identify patients likely or unlikely to benefit from EVT in the late window. Methods: The multinational Computed Tomography for Late Endovascular Reperfusion (CLEAR) observational cohort of consecutive patients with acute proximal intracranial occlusion (2014-2022) was queried (n=58 sites). Logistic regression analyses were used to derive an 8-point score for predicting good functional outcome (mRS 0-2 or return to premorbid mRS) at 90 days, with sensitivity analyses for pre-specified subgroups conducted using bootstrapped random forest regressions and was externally validated with a single center cohort (2014-2023). Secondary outcomes included 90-day functional independence (mRS 0-2), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), poor outcome (mRS 5-6), and 90-day survival. Findings: Of the 3231 included patients (n=2499 treated with EVT), an 8-point CLEAR score included age, ASPECTS, and National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), with higher points indicating a higher probability of a good functional outcome. The areas under the curve (AUC) for the primary outcome among EVT and BMM subgroups were 0·72 (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 0·70-0·74) and 0·87 (95\% CI: 0·84-0·90), respectively, with similar performance in the external validation cohort (AUC 0·71, 95\% CI: 0·66-0·76). There was a significant interaction between CLEAR score and EVT treatment for good functional outcome, functional independence, and poor outcome (all pinteraction <0·001), with greater benefit favoring patients with lower and mid-range CLEAR scores. Interpretation: The CLEAR Thrombectomy Success Score is a pragmatic tool that can estimate the probability of a good outcome in patients treated with EVT versus BMM in the late window for proximal anterior circulation occlusion. Funding: Medtronic.",  author   = "Siegler, \{James E.\} and Volker Puetz and Marc Ribo and Mohamad Abdalkader and Jo{\~a}o Marto and Al-Bayati, \{Alhamza R.\} and Hiroshi Yamagami and Haussen, \{Diogo C.\} and Marta Oliv{\'e}-Gadea and Simon Winzer and Mahmoud Mohammaden and Manisha Koneru and Robin Lemmens and Kanta Tanaka and Pekka Virtanen and Anne Dusart and Flavio Bellante and Kaiser, \{Daniel P.

Selection is mostly based on simple thresholding of perfusion parameter maps, which, however, does not exploit the full information hidden in the high-dimensional perfusion data. We implemented a multiparametric mass-univariate logistic model to predict tissue outcome based on data from 405 stroke patients with acute proximal vessel occlusion in the anterior circulation who underwent mechanical thrombectomy. Input parameters were acute multimodal CT imaging (perfusion, angiography, and non-contrast) as well as basic demographic and clinical parameters. The model was trained with the knowledge of recanalization status and final infarct localization. We found that perfusion parameter maps (CBF, CBV, and Tmax) were sufficient for tissue outcome prediction. Compared with single-parameter thresholding-based models, our logistic model had comparable volumetric accuracy, but was superior with respect to topographical accuracy (AUC of receiver operating characteristic). We also found higher spatial accuracy (Dice index) in an independent internal but not external cross-validation. Our results highlight the value of perfusion data compared with non-contrast CT, CT angiography and clinical information for tissue outcome-prediction. Multiparametric logistic prediction has high potential to outperform the single-parameter thresholding-based approach.

However, the availability of this technique is limited. We, therefore, established the novel concept of computed tomography (CT) hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch, i.e., an ischemic core lesion visible on cerebral perfusion CT without visible hypodensity in the corresponding native cerebral CT. We compared both methods regarding their accuracy in identifying patients suitable for thrombolysis.METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of the MissPerfeCT observational cohort study, patients were classified as suitable or not for thrombolysis based on established time window and imaging criteria. We calculated predictive values for hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch and automated perfusion imaging to compare accuracy in the identification of patients suitable for thrombolysis.RESULTS: Of 247 patients, 219 (88.7\%) were eligible for thrombolysis and 28 (11.3\%) were not eligible for thrombolysis. Of 197 patients who were within 4.5 h of symptom onset, 190 (96.4\%) were identified by hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch and 88 (44.7\%) by automated perfusion mismatch (p < 0.001). Of 22 patients who were beyond 4.5 h of symptom onset but were eligible for thrombolysis, 5 patients (22.7\%) were identified by hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch. Predictive values for the hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch vs. automated perfusion mismatch were as follows: sensitivity, 89.0\% vs. 50.2\%; specificity, 71.4\% vs. 100.0\%; positive predictive value, 96.1\% vs. 100.0\%; and negative predictive value, 45.5\% vs. 20.4\%.CONCLUSION: The novel method of hypoperfusion-hypodensity mismatch can identify patients suitable for thrombolysis with higher sensitivity and lower specificity than established techniques.

Patients treated with EVT or MM were compared with multivariable logistic regression and inverse probability of treatment weighting. The coprimary outcomes were the 90-day modified Rankin Scale ordinal shift and ≥2-point decrease in the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale.RESULTS: Of 1023 patients, 589 (57.6\%) were male with median (interquartile range) age of 74 (64-82) years. The median (interquartile range) National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale was 6 (3-10). The occlusion segments were P1 (41.2\%), P2 (49.2\%), and P3 (7.1\%). Overall, intravenous thrombolysis was administered in 43\% and EVT in 37\%.

Methods We performed a search of three databases and included series with ≥10 patients, with unruptured aneurysms of the ICA and NOS, treated with FD. Random-effects analysis of treatment results and safety was performed. Results A total of 22 studies reporting on 594 patients were included. Pooled proportions of NOS recovery, improvement, transient and permanent worsening were: 47.4\% (95\% CI 35.0\% to 60.1\%); 74.5\% (95\% CI 67.9\% to 80.2\%); 7.1\% (95\% CI 3.3\% to 14.7\%); and 4.9\% (95\% CI 3.2\% to 7.4\%), respectively. Rates of complete recovery and improvement in patients with isolated visual symptoms were 30.6\% (95\% CI 12.5\% to 57.7\%) and 56.6\% (95\% CI 42.3\% to 69.9\%). Isolated oculomotor symptoms recovered completely in 47.8\% (95\% CI 29.9\% to 66.3\%) and improved in 78\% (95\% CI 69.2\% to 84.9\%).

This study aimed to assess CT attenuation values (Hounsfield Units (HU)) and net water uptake (NWU) in RSSI and explore a postprocessing algorithm{\textquoteright}s potential to enhance thalamic RSSI detection. We examined non-contrast CT (NCCT) data from patients with confirmed thalamic RSSI on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) between January 2010 and October 2017. Co-registered DW-MRI and NCCT images enabled HU and NWU quantification in the infarct area compared to unaffected contralateral tissue. Results were categorized based on symptom onset to NCCT timing. Postprocessing using window optimization and frequency-selective non-linear blending (FSNLB) was applied, with interpretations by three blinded Neuroradiologists. The study included 34 patients (median age 70 years [IQR 63–76], 14 women). RSSI exhibited significantly reduced mean CT attenuation compared to unaffected thalamus (29.6 HU (±3.1) vs. 33.3 HU (±2.6); p < 0.01). Mean NWU in the infarct area increased from 6.4\% (±7.2) at 0–6 h to 16.6\% (±8.7) at 24–36 h post-symptom onset. Postprocessed NCCT using these HU values improved sensitivity for RSSI detection from 32\% in unprocessed CT to 41\% in FSNLB-optimized CT, with specificities ranging from 86\% to 95\%.

The aim of this study was to compare the incidence and outcome of patients with perforation during MeVO and large vessel occlusion (LVO) thrombectomy and to report on the procedural steps that led to perforation.METHODS: In this multicenter retrospective cohort study, data of consecutive patients with vessel perforation during thrombectomy between January 1, 2015 and September 30, 2022 were collected. The primary outcomes were independent functional outcome (ie, modified Rankin Scale 0-2) and all-cause mortality at 90 days. Binomial test, chi-squared test and t-test for unpaired samples were used for statistical analysis.RESULTS: During 25 769 thrombectomies (5124 MeVO, 20 645 LVO) in 25 stroke centers, perforation occurred in 335 patients (1.3\%; mean age 72 years, 62\% female). Perforation occurred more often in MeVO thrombectomy (2.4\%) than in LVO thrombectomy (1.0\%, p<0.001). More MeVO than LVO patients with perforation achieved functional independence at 3 months (25.7\% vs 10.9\%, p=0.001). All-cause mortality did not differ between groups (overall 51.6\%). Navigation beyond the occlusion and retraction of stent retriever/aspiration catheter were the two most common procedural steps that led to perforation.CONCLUSIONS: In our cohort, perforation was approximately twice as frequent in MeVO than in LVO thrombectomy.

Methods This study analyzed a subset of children enrolled in SaveChildS, a retrospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of 73 pediatric patients with stroke who underwent thrombectomy between 2000 and 2018 at 27 US and European centers. Included patients had baseline angiographic imaging and follow-up modified Rankin Scale scores available for review. Posterior circulation occlusions were excluded. Cerebrovascular collaterals were graded on acute neuroimaging by 2 blinded neuroradiologists according to the Tan collateral score, in which favorable collaterals are defined as >50\% filling and unfavorable collaterals as <50\% filling distal to the occluded vessel.

Methods In this retrospective study, a decision-analytic Markov model estimated lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Early outcome parameters were based on the entire Save ChildS Study to model the EVT group. As no randomized data exist, the Save ChildS patient subgroup with unsuccessful recanalization was used to model the standard of care group.

Incomplete occlusion at follow-up was less frequently observed in aneurysms treated with additional coil embolization (OR, 0.1; 95\% CI, 0.01–0.86; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: Although a promising treatment for compressive ICA aneurysms, flow diversion carries a relevant risk for complications and incomplete aneurysm occlusion.

We studied this subject in a retrospective international multicenter series, pooling data of 9 tertiary care neurointerventional departments. OBJECTIVE: To investigate, in a retrospective, multicentric cohort of patients presenting with visual or oculomotor symptoms attributed to a compressive carotid artery in an unruptured intracranial aneurysm, the safety and efficacy profiles of FDS, by analyzing neuro-opthalmologic symptom evolution following FDS placement, complications, and aneurysm obliteration rates. METHODS: All patients treated since 2015 with a FDS for an unruptured aneurysm of the ICA with signs of compressive cranial nerve symptoms (CN II, III, IV, VI) were included. RESULTS: We treated 55 patients with 55 aneurysms; 21 (38.2\%) patients had oculomotor and 15 (27.3\%) visual symptoms only; 19 (34.5\%) presented with a combination of both. Treatment-related morbidity/mortality occurred in 7.2\% and 3.6\%, respectively. At last imaging follow-up (13.1±10.5 months) rates of complete aneurysm occlusion, neck remnant, and aneurysm remnant were 72\%, 14\%, and 14\%, respectively. At last clinical follow-up after 13±10.5 months, 19/51 (37.3\%) patients had recovered completely and 18/51 (35.3\%) had recovered at least partially from their neuro-ophthalmological symptoms. In multivariable models, a longer delay between symptom onset and treatment was associated with higher odds for incomplete recovery and lower odds for any improvement (aOR 1.03 (95\% CI 1.01 to 1.07), p=0.047 and 0.04 (0-0.81), p=0.020). Incomplete recovery was independently associated with older age and fusiform aneurysms. CONCLUSION: FDS are effective to treat patients with compressive aneurysms of the ICA causing neuro-ophthalmological symptoms, especially when treatment is initiated early after symptom onset, and aneurysm occlusion is adequate.

We evaluated differences in the incidence, severity of aSAH presentation, and ruptured aneurysm treatment modality during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the preceding year. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study including 49 countries and 187 centres. We recorded volumes for COVID-19 hospitalisations, aSAH hospitalisations, Hunt-Hess grade, coiling, clipping and aSAH in-hospital mortality. Diagnoses were identified by International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, codes or stroke databases from January 2019 to May 2021. Results Over the study period, there were 16 247 aSAH admissions, 344 491 COVID-19 admissions, 8300 ruptured aneurysm coiling and 4240 ruptured aneurysm clipping procedures. Declines were observed in aSAH admissions (-6.4\% (95\% CI-7.0\% to-5.8\%), p=0.0001) during the first year of the pandemic compared with the prior year, most pronounced in high-volume SAH and high-volume COVID-19 hospitals. There was a trend towards a decline in mild and moderate presentations of subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) (mild:-5\% (95\% CI-5.9\% to-4.3\%), p=0.06; moderate:-8.3\% (95\% CI-10.2\% to-6.7\%), p=0.06) but no difference in higher SAH severity. The ruptured aneurysm clipping rate remained unchanged (30.7\% vs 31.2\%, p=0.58), whereas ruptured aneurysm coiling increased (53.97\% vs 56.5\%, p=0.009). There was no difference in aSAH in-hospital mortality rate (19.1\% vs 20.1\%, p=0.12). Conclusion During the first year of the pandemic, there was a decrease in aSAH admissions volume, driven by a decrease in mild to moderate presentation of aSAH.

Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed of consecutive acute stroke patients with COVID-19 infection treated with MT at 26 tertiary care centers between January 2020 and November 2021. Baseline demographics, angiographic outcome and clinical outcome evaluated by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at discharge and 90 days were noted. Results: We identified 111 out of 11 365 (1\%) patients with acute or subsided COVID-19 infection who underwent MT due to LVO. Cardioembolic events were the most common etiology for LVO (38.7\%).

We dichotomized the admission period to 2016–2017 and 2018–2020 according to the main process optimization, including the introduction of a prenotification call. RESULTS: We included 869 DS patients (median age 76 years (IQR 65–82), NIHSS 16 (IQR 11–21), 278 min (IQR 243–335) from onset to EVT); 566 were transferred in 2018–2020.

We developed a simplified algorithm based on region of interest (ROI) measurements to quantify water uptake of the ischemic lesion and thereby quantify time of symptom onset within and beyond 4.5 hours. Perfusion CT was used to identify ischemic brain tissue, and its density was measured in non-contrast CT and related to the density of the corresponding area of the contralateral hemisphere to quantify lesion water uptake.RESULTS: Of 263 patients, 204 (77.6\%) had CT within 4.5 hours.

In surveys conducted by the Young Radiology Forum of the German Roentgen Society in 2018 and 2020, physicians undergoing specialist training in radiology rated supervision with case discussion, a structured specialist training curriculum, and a fixed rotation schedule as the most helpful tools for successful specialist training [2] However, according to those surveyed, 63 \% of all radiology training centers and 48 \% of university hospitals did not have a structured training curriculum [2]. Even though a “structured program for specialist training [...] must be provided” (Model Specialist Training Regulations § 5 (6) [1]) when applying for specialist training authorization, physicians undergoing specialist training are apparently not sufficiently aware of these structured programs. Moreover, the scope and depth of existing local curricula vary which is a disadvantage with respect to ensuring a uniformly high training standard.

Methods: From January 2016 to December 2019, consecutive stroke patients with a BAO and first-line CA were analyzed in this retrospective study. We assessed baseline and imaging characteristics and treatment and clinical outcomes. We rated thrombus surface phenotype on pre-treatment digital subtraction angiography in a three-reader-consensus setting. Primary outcome was complete recanalization (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia [mTICI] 3 and arterial occlusive lesion [AOL] 3) after first-line CA without additionally stent retriever passes. Data analysis was stratified according to thrombus surface phenotype and complete first-line recanalization. Results: Seventy-eight patients met the inclusion criteria.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, combined with the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) as a classifier, was used to assess which parameter is the most suitable for short-term, intermediate-term, and overall mortality prediction. Interrater agreement was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: The highest discriminative power to distinguish between deceased and survivors was found for the adrenal gland-to-spleen ratio for the 72-h mortality.

Furthermore, in T2*/susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) sequences the structural integrity of the Nigrosome 1 (N1) can be assessed by checking the presence of the swallow tail sign (STS). We therefore retrospectively compared the performance of the 6-[18F]FDOPA PET with the N1 detection in patients suspected with parkinsonian diseases. Forty-three consecutive patients (m: 23, f: 20, mean age: 63 ± 12 years) were included in the study. They underwent clinically indicated 6-[18F]FDOPA PET/MRI scans as part of their neurological evaluation of uncertain parkinsonian syndromes. Visual and semi-quantitative PET imaging results were statistically compared with visual N1 assessment on 3 T SWI. As the gold standard, we defined the clinical diagnosis at the last follow-up, which included idiopathic Parkinson syndrome (IPS; n = 18), atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APS; n = 9) and other neurological diseases without dopaminergic deficit (n = 16). Results: Thirty-five of 43 patients (81\%, Kappa 0.611) had corresponding results in 6-[18F]FDOPA PET and SWI. Seven of the remaining 8 patients were correctly diagnosed by 6-[18F]FDOPA PET alone. Sensitivity, specificity and accuracy for 6-[18F]FDOPA and N1 imaging were 93\%, 94\%, 93\% and 82\%, 75\%, 79\%, respectively. Conclusions: 6-[18F]FDOPA PET and Nigrosome 1 evaluation had an overall good intermodality agreement. Diagnostic agreement was very good in cases of clinically suspected idiopathic Parkinson syndrome and fair in atypical parkinsonian syndromes, but poor in patients with non-parkinsonian disorders. 6-[18F]FDOPA PET showed higher sensitivity, specificity and accuracy in discriminating parkinsonian syndromes from non-parkinsonian disorders than the N1 evaluation.

We assessed patients' characteristics, procedural data and clinical outcome. Thrombus surface on pretreatment digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was categorized into regular versus irregular phenotype by blinded three-reader-consensus. Primary outcome was successful reperfusion (modified treatment in cerebral ischemia (mTICI) 2b-3) after first pass.

For basilar artery occlusion, recent randomized clinical trials demonstrated not only equipoise but also advantages for EVT under particular circumstances. It remains unclear whether EVT offers an advantage over best medical management (BMM) including thrombolysis (IVT) in isolated occlusion of the proximal posterior cerebral artery (PCAO). Methods: Patients with AIS due to PCAO proven by CT or MR angiography were retrospectively identified from local databases at four comprehensive stroke centers in Germany, USA, and Taiwan between 2012 and 2020. Demographic and clinical data were collected, and imaging characteristics including pretherapeutic, interventional, and follow-up imaging were reviewed locally at each center. Patients were grouped according to therapy, i.e., BMM including IVT alone vs. BMM and EVT. Efficacy endpoints were early neurological improvement (ENI) after 24 h or at discharge, good outcome (modified Rankin scale 0–2) after 3 months, as well as hemorrhagic complications and in-house deaths as safety endpoints. Results: We included 130 patients of whom 23 (17.7\%) received EVT. EVT patients had more proximal occlusions (69.9 vs. 43\%, p = 0.023) and had a better premorbid function [premorbid mRS, 0 (0–4) vs. 1 (0–3), p < 0.01] when compared to BMM patients. IVT showed a trend toward being less performed in the EVT group (21.7 vs. 41.1\%, p = 0.1), while other baseline parameters were balanced. Successful reperfusion was achieved in 52\% of EVT patients. ENI was more frequent in the EVT group (61 vs. 35.5\%, p = 0.034). Good outcome at 90 days and safety endpoints did not differ. In a bivariate analysis, ENI was independently predicted by the use of EVT (OR, 2.76; CI, 1.055–7.04) and the baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (OR, 1.082; CI, 1.027–1.141 per point increase).

However, device selection for thrombectomy may influence rates of recanalization, complications, and neurological outcomes, especially in pediatric patients of different ages. We, therefore, performed additional analyses of the Save ChildS data to investigate a possible association of different thrombectomy techniques and devices with angiographic and clinical outcome parameters. Methods - The Save ChildS cohort study (January 2000-December 2018) analyzed data from 27 European and United States stroke centers and included all pediatric patients (<18 years), diagnosed with arterial ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular recanalization. Patients were grouped into first-line contact aspiration (A Direct Aspiration First Pass Technique [ADAPT]) and non-ADAPT groups as well as different stent retriever size groups.

The primary outcome was a favourable functional outcome 90 days after randomisation, defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of 0-2. Secondary outcomes were measures of neurological disability, functional independence in activities of daily living, excellent functional outcome (mRS 0-1), and mortality. The analysis was done in the intention-to-treat population and adjusted for age, sex, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score, ASPECTS, occlusion location, site, alteplase use, and declared first device. The safety population included all patients who received any amount of study drug. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02930018.FINDINGS: Between March 1, 2017, and Aug 12, 2019, 1105 patients were randomly assigned to receive nerinetide (n=549) or placebo (n=556). 337 (61·4\%) of 549 patients with nerinetide and 329 (59·2\%) of 556 with placebo achieved an mRS score of 0-2 at 90 days (adjusted risk ratio 1·04, 95\% CI 0·96-1·14; p=0·35). Secondary outcomes were similar between groups. We observed evidence of treatment effect modification resulting in inhibition of treatment effect in patients receiving alteplase. Serious adverse events occurred equally between groups.INTERPRETATION: Nerinetide did not improve the proportion of patients achieving good clinical outcomes after endovascular thrombectomy compared with patients receiving placebo.FUNDING: Canadian Institutes for Health Research, Alberta Innovates, and NoNO.",  keywords  = "Acute Disease, Aged, Aged, 80 and over, Brain Ischemia/complications, Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein/drug effects, Double-Blind Method, Endovascular Procedures, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged, Neuroprotective Agents/adverse effects, Peptides/adverse effects, Stroke/drug therapy, Thrombectomy, Treatment Outcome",  author    = "\{ESCAPE-NA1 Investigators\} and Hill, \{Michael D.\} and Mayank Goyal and Menon, \{Bijoy K.\} and Nogueira, \{Raul G.\} and McTaggart, \{Ryan A.\} and Demchuk, \{Andrew M.\} and Poppe, \{Alexandre Y.\} and Buck, \{Brian H.\} and Field, \{Thalia S.\} and Dar Dowlatshahi and \{van Adel\}, \{Brian A.\} and Swartz, \{Richard H.\} and Shah, \{Ruchir A.\} and Eric Sauvageau and Charlotte Zerna and Ospel, \{Johanna M.\} and Manish Joshi and Almekhlafi, \{Mohammed A.\} and Ryckborst, \{Karla J.\} and Lowerison, \{Mark W.\} and Kathy Heard and David Garman and Diogo Haussen and Cutting, \{Shawna M.\} and Coutts, \{Shelagh B.\} and Daniel Roy and Rempel, \{Jeremy L.\} and Rohr, \{Axel CR\} and Daniela Iancu and Sahlas, \{Demetrios J.\} and Yu, \{Amy Y.X.\} and Devlin, \{Thomas G.\} and Hanel, \{Ricardo A.\} and Volker Puetz and Silver, \{Frank L.\} and Campbell, \{Bruce C.V.\} and Ren{\'e} Chapot and Jeanne Teitelbaum and Mandzia, \{Jennifer L.\} and Shuo Chen and Matthias Schmidt and Anna Steinberg and Johannes Gerber and Daniel Kaiser and Simon Winzer and Pallesen, \{Lars Peder\} and Timo Siepmann and Kristian Barlinn and Julia M{\"u}ller and Nicole M{\"u}ller",  note      = "Copyright {\textcopyright} 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Objective: To evaluate the use of endovascular recanalization in pediatric patients with arterial ischemic stroke. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective, multicenter cohort study, conducted from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2018, analyzed the databases from 27 stroke centers in Europe and the United States. Included were all pediatric patients (<18 years) with ischemic stroke who underwent endovascular recanalization. Median follow-up time was 16 months. Exposures: Endovascular recanalization. Main Outcomes and Measures: The decrease of the Pediatric National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (PedNIHSS) score from admission to day 7 was the primary outcome (score range: 0 [no deficit] to 34 [maximum deficit]). Secondary clinical outcomes included the modified Rankin scale (mRS) (score range: 0 [no deficit] to 6 [death]) at 6 and 24 months and rate of complications. Results: Seventy-three children from 27 participating stroke centers were included. Median age was 11.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 7.0-15.0); 37 patients (51\%) were boys, and 36 patients (49\%) were girls. Sixty-three children (86\%) received treatment for anterior circulation occlusion and 10 patients (14\%) received treatment for posterior circulation occlusion; 16 patients (22\%) received concomitant intravenous thrombolysis. Neurologic outcome improved from a median PedNIHSS score of 14.0 (IQR, 9.2-20.0) at admission to 4.0 (IQR, 2.0-7.3) at day 7. Median mRS score was 1.0 (IQR, 0-1.6) at 6 months and 1.0 (IQR, 0-1.0) at 24 months. One patient (1\%) developed a postinterventional bleeding complication and 4 patients (5\%) developed transient peri-interventional vasospasm. The proportion of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage events in the HERMES meta-analysis of trials with adults was 2.79 (95\% CI, 0.42-6.66) and in Save ChildS was 1.37 (95\% CI, 0.03-7.40). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this study suggest that the safety profile of thrombectomy in childhood stroke does not differ from the safety profile in randomized clinical trials for adults; most of the treated children had favorable neurologic outcomes. This study may support clinicians' practice of off-label thrombectomy in childhood stroke in the absence of high-level evidence.",  author    = "Sporns, \{Peter B.\} and Ronald Str{\"a}ter and Jens Minnerup and Heinz Wiendl and Uta Hanning and Ren{\'e} Chapot and Hans Henkes and Elina Henkes and Astrid Grams and Franziska Dorn and Omid Nikoubashman and Martin Wiesmann and Georg Bier and Anushe Weber and Gabriel Broocks and Jens Fiehler and Alex Brehm and Marios Psychogios and Daniel Kaiser and Umut Yilmaz and Andrea Morotti and Wolfgang Marik and Richard Nolz and Ulf Jensen-Kondering and Bernd Schmitz and Stefan Schob and Oliver Beuing and Friedrich G{\"o}tz and Johannes Trenkler and Bernd Turowski and Markus M{\"o}hlenbruch and Christina Wendl and Peter Schramm and Patricia Musolino and Sarah Lee and Marc Schlamann and Alexander Radbruch and Nicole R{\"u}bsamen and Andr{\'e} Karch and Walter Heindel and Moritz Wildgruber and Andr{\'e} Kemmling",  note      = "Publisher Copyright: {\textcopyright} 2019 American Medical Association.

Methods: We retrospectively included patients with the following characteristics: acute BAO or occlusion of the intracranial vertebral artery (ICVA) and endovascular therapy (EVT) with stentriever (SRT) or aspiration thrombectomy (AT). Additional extra- but not intracranial EVT and intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) were allowed. Results: Between January 2013 and April 2016, 33 patients fulfilled the criteria (13 treated with SRT, 20 with AT). Prior to EVT, 23 (70\%) patients received IVT. The proximal intracranial occlusion was ICVA in 2 patients, proximal BA in 5 patients, middle BA in 20 patients, and distal BA in 6 patients. Mean time to treatment was 334 min (95\% CI 276–391 min). Procedure duration differed significantly (p = 0.002) as follows: 97 min with SRT (95\% CI 69–124 min) and 55 min with AT (95\% CI 43–66 min). Recanalization (arterial occlusive lesion (AOL) 2/3) was achieved in 26 patients (79\%). Complete recanalization (AOL 3) happened more often with AT (75\% (95\% CI 65–85\%)) compared to SRT (46\% (95\% CI 32–60\%)). Conversion rate 6\% (two patients). Hemorrhages occurred in 12 (36\%) patients, periprocedural complications in eight (three dissections, five embolizations to new territory) (no group difference). Ten patients (30\%) had a favorable outcome (mRS ≤3) at discharge; mortality rate was 24\% (eight deaths) (no group difference). Conclusion: In primarily embolic BAO, aspiration thrombectomy was faster, effective and not detrimental to outcome as compared to stentriever thrombectomy.

The progressive remodeling of brain microvessels due to arterial hypertension or other vascular risk factors causes subtle, but constant cognitive decline through to manifest dementia and substantially increases the risk for stroke. Preliminary evidence suggests the contribution of the immune system to disease initiation and progression, but a more detailed understanding is impaired by the unavailability of appropriate animal models. Here, we introduce the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) as a model for early onset cSVD and unveiled substantial immune changes in conjunction with brain abnormalities that resemble clinical findings. Results: In contrast to age-matched normotensive Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats, male SHR exhibited non-spatial memory deficits. Magnetic resonance imaging showed brain atrophy and a reduction of white matter volumes in SHR. Histological analyses confirmed white matter demyelination and unveiled a circumscribed blood brain barrier dysfunction in conjunction with micro- and macrogliosis in deep cortical regions. Flow cytometry and histological analyses further revealed substantial disparities in cerebral CD45high leukocyte counts and distribution patterns between SHR and WKY. SHR showed lower counts of T cells in the choroid plexus and meningeal spaces as well as decreased interleukin-10 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. On the other hand, both T and NK cells were significantly augmented in the SHR brain microvasculature.
